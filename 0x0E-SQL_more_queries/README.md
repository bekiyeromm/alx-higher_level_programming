Use “container-on-demand” to run MySQL
In the container, credentials are root/root

Ask for container Ubuntu 20.04
Connect via SSH
OR connect via the Web terminal
In the container, you should start MySQL before playing with it:
$ service mysql start                                                   
 * Starting MySQL database server mysqld
